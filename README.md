Water Pump Functionality Prediction
Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying the functionality status of water pumps in Tanzania. Using data from Taarifa and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water, the model classifies water pumps into three categories: functional, needing repair, and non-functional. This solution assists the Tanzanian government in prioritizing maintenance efforts, optimizing resource allocation, and ensuring reliable access to clean water for communities across the country.

Business and Data Understanding
Stakeholder Audience
Our primary stakeholder is the Tanzanian government, responsible for managing and maintaining water infrastructure nationwide. The goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of maintenance operations, ensuring consistent access to reliable and clean water for all communities.

Dataset Choice
The dataset includes a comprehensive range of features related to water pump functionality, such as extraction type, management type, water quality, and quantity. This data, sourced from Taarifa and the Ministry of Water, provides insights into pump conditions and usage patterns essential for accurate predictions.

Modeling
Feature Selection and Engineering
Extensive feature engineering was performed to identify and create relevant variables impacting water pump functionality. We tested various subsets of features to ensure the model effectively captured all critical information.

Model Development and Tuning
Initial Model: We began with a baseline model and iteratively refined it to improve performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: We fine-tuned the Decision Tree Classifier with a focus on:
Weights: Adjusting class weights to handle dataset imbalance and ensure balanced performance across all classes.
Max Depth: Setting the maximum depth to prevent overfitting while capturing necessary data patterns.
Criterion: Evaluating different criteria (gini and entropy) for optimal node splitting.
Model Selection and Evaluation
Classification Models: We evaluated various classification algorithms, including Decision Trees and Logistic Regression. The Decision Tree Classifier was selected based on superior performance metrics.
Metrics Comparison: We compared metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score for different models and datasets (both with and without certain features) to determine the most effective model.
Handling Class Imbalance
Techniques such as SMOTE were used to address class imbalances, ensuring robust performance across all categories, particularly for minority classes.

Evaluation
The model was evaluated using key performance metrics, including accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score. The Decision Tree Classifier demonstrated high performance across all metrics, validating its effectiveness in predicting pump functionality.

Predictive Recommendation
Contexts for Model Predictions
Useful Contexts: The model is highly beneficial in scenarios requiring prompt maintenance decisions, such as in remote or rural areas with limited repair services.
Less Effective Contexts: It may be less effective in rapidly changing conditions or where historical data does not accurately reflect current situations.
Suggestions for Improving Accuracy
Data Accuracy: Ensure up-to-date and accurate data on pump conditions and maintenance histories. Some columns, like amount_tsh, were dropped due to high missing values.
Feature Engineering: Introduce additional features related to pump usage patterns, maintenance history, and environmental conditions to enhance model performance.
Conclusion
The Decision Tree Classifier, finely tuned through an iterative process, provides a reliable solution for classifying water pumps into functional, repair-needed, and non-functional categories. This model supports the Tanzanian government in improving maintenance efficiency and resource allocation, ensuring consistent water availability across the country. Its interpretability and robust performance make it a valuable tool for decision-making and future infrastructure management.

The project has successfully developed a high-performing predictive model that addresses a critical infrastructure challenge, delivering tangible benefits for the Tanzanian government and its citizens. The systematic approach to model development, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation has ensured that the chosen model meets the stakeholder's needs.
